You'll need something like this https://www.adafruit.com/product/1512

where the Raspberry Pi Header Pin numbers are the little ones on the inside of the diagram below.

If you've had to read this section, please see the disclaimer below.

Needs to be run as root - 

    sudo python initialfile.py
    
Refer this diagram ![](https://github.com/nancygoel62/Smart-Secure-Device/raw/master/circuit.png)

Disclaimer

It works for me, but connecting stuff to your Raspberry Pi can destroy either end.
